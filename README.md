"# LearnWebDev" 

This repository is where I will make commits to anything new that I learn in either web development or software development that can be used for web development.

For example my first commit is based around Python as I hadn't programmed in it much before so I decided to learn it.
I did a bit too much with it as I jumped in headfirst with a rock paper scissors game, it has no checks and no game counter, I may add them in later commits however.
